The tools
=========

The tools, which have been added to pkgsrc/sysutils/patchadd recently,
consist of the following tools:

 - patch_add, a tool to apply binary patches,
 - patch_delete, a tool to back out a patch added without -r, and
 - patch_info, a tool to display the list of installed patches.

Still missing are the tools:

 - patch_tool, a tool to figure out which patches still need to be
   applied, and optionally install them, and
 - mkpatchdir, a tool to generate a directory index in a directory full
   of patches.
 - Potentially even a tool to generate patch sets from two directories
   or such.

I'm working on them and I'm consequently going to rewrite the other
tools. Until then, use the existing tools. The future tools will be
compatible with the current file format. (And syntax.)

The patch format
================

The second important part about patchadd is how to create a binary
patch set to be applied. The format basically follows the instructions
laid down in http://github.com/caoimhechaos/patchadd-tests/

The patch file itself is basically a tar file. The file contains:

 - Arbitrarily named bsdiff(1) patches lifting the file from old to new.
 - A file called +INFO, containing pure metadata about the patch one
   information per line, such as:
   * ABI: the OS ABI (e.g. ABI=NetBSD)
   * OS_VERSION: the OS version (e.g. OS_VERSION=5.0)
   * MACHINE_ARCH: the machine architecture (e.g. MACHINE_ARCH=vax)
   * PATCHTOOLS: the file format version (e.g. PATCHTOOLS=0.1)
   * NAME: The name of the patch, frequently the file name. A form for
     this would have to be agreed on; I would suggest the pullup
     request ID (e.g. NAME=4123). Can be free form though, and does not
     have to be the same as the file name.
   * VERSION: The version of the patch. A patch can be re-released in a
     new version if appropriate, and would be suggested as an upgrade
     by patch_tool.
   * COMMENT: A punchline describing the text. This should be a short
     description which is shown in patch_infos overview output.
   * DEPENDS: The name of a different patch file to depend on. This
     line may appear as many times as required, but please only add one
     dependent patch per line.
   * CONFLICTS: The name of a different patch which cannot coexist with
     this patch. The same rules as for DEPENDS apply.
 - A file called +COMMENT containing a longer description (optional).
 - A file called +CONTENTS, containing information about each contained
   binary diff (one line per file, tab separated):
   * The name of the file in the system to be patched, e.g. /bin/ksh
   * The name of the patch file in the diff, free form file name
   * The SHA-1 sum the file is expected to be in before patching, and
   * the SHA-1 sum the file is supposed to have after patching.

The tar file is not distributed as-is but as a bzip2 compressed OpenSSL
binary file (.tbz) with detached signature (.tbz.sig). The command

 openssl smime -sign -binary -outform PEM -signer signingkey.pem -in
    patchname.tbz -out patchname.tbz.sig

shall be used to produce the detached signature.

The patch index
===============

The patches shall be kept in a directory called
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/${path}/${arch}/${vers}/, e.g. 
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/tonnerre/binpatches/amd64/5.0/

The directory shall contain a file named patchindex. This file starts
with a version statement:

Version 0.1

to indicate that the patch file format version 0.1 is used. This
statement is followed by a list of all patch metadata for each patch,
starting with the Patch keyword and ending with the EndPatch keyword.
Multiple consecutive words in a value have to be quoted. For example:

Patch 4123
ABI=NetBSD
OS_VERSION=4.0
[...]
COMMENT="A patch to add a funny hat to stargazer"
EndPatch

The patch index is then amended with an OpenSSL s/mime inline text
signature executed with the patch signing key.

This index file is used solely for the patch_tool utility. Even without
this patch index, people can still safely run patch_add 4123 to add the
patch.
